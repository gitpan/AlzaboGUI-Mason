This package contains a data modelling GUI for Alzabo implemented with
HTML::Mason.

This interface was designed by John Skelton (www.afrojet.com).

To install the interface, run the following commands:

 perl Build.PL

 ./Build install

The installation process is interactive.

To actually use this GUI you will need to set up your web server to
use Mason.  See the Mason documentation for details.

You'll want to make sure that JPEG files are not served by Mason in
whatever directory you install the data modelling tool.  For Apache,
you can use a configure something like this:

  <Location /alzabo>
    SetHandler  perl-script
    PerlHandler HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
  </Location>

  <LocationMatch "/alzabo/.*\.jpg$">
    SetHandler  default
  </Location>
